            <h3>Tyler Schill</h3>
            <p>Hi all, I'm Tyler. In the image is me with my wife Johanna while on vacation in Cancun. I have been
                 a member since birth and served a mission in Costa Rica where I learned Spanish. I am currently
                 studying international studies and taking this calss as one of my electives. I took a Procedural
                 Programming in C++ cass prior to this semester (apparently they got rid of that class) but I am
                 mostly interested in this class because it might help me be more useful at (one of) my jobs wher I
                 work as an IT/IS Admin. <br><br>
                 I think many of the technologies we use today depend more and more on the web, and html/css is only
                 a piece of the story but I feel like many of the technolgies have shifted from being desktop
                 applications, to more mobile or mostly web-powered programs. So I feel like becoming familiar with
                 web development even if its only to a small degree could be helpful in many cases.<br><br>
    
                 I look forward to learning html and I am especiallly interested in CSS since that seems to be where
                 most of the magic goes on visually.
