      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to have a website that works like a resume and maybe even where I can offer my services working with computers and system to others and acquire clientele as a side job/business. The website will be a portfolio of sorts, with important info like a resume being communicated and examples of my work so that others can consider my services as viable. The unique aspect of my offer is that I would offer lower rates and tailor solutions to a client's needs. Custom technology solutions in a phrase</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently a junior at BYU-Idaho pursuing a degree in international relations with a focus on business administration. I have acquired over the years certain skills and knowledge when it comes to technology simply because it fascinates me and has always held my interest. This has led me to certain job positions and taking programming classes both at the university and independently through other platforms. I work with small business to develop technology solutions through the application of software, hardware and other tools that can help solve problems and open up new opportunities at the business.
