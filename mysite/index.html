                <p>I am currently a Junior at BYU-Idaho pursuing a degree in international relations with a focus 
                    on business administration. I have acquired over the years certain skills and knowledge when 
                    it comes to technology simply because it fascinates me and has always held my interest. This
                    has led me to certain job positions and taking programming classes both at the university and
                    independently through other platforms. I work with small business to develop technology 
                    solutions through the application of software, hardware and other tools that can help solve
                    problems and open up new opportunities at the business.

                        Sherwood Pines has been one of my greatest success stories. A small memory care facility in Oregon, the COVID-19
                        pandemic put the new business' owners in a new challenge of overhauling their technology to permit work from home
                        situations for management and other employees as much as possible.Challenges complying with HIPAA regulations were 
                        overcome and the business continues to find value in continual investment in technology solutions after I helped them
                        achieve success in that are. See them <a href="https://www.sherwoodpines.com" target="_blank">here.</a>

                        Hunsaker Home has been another success story. They are a small Adult Foster Care in Oregon who also was affected by the COVID-19
                        pandemic their main goal was to have a more accessible file storage solution and a simple website. Social media upkeep was
                        also required in their search to have a better online presence to attract clients and potential employees. Though they are 
                        a very small business, they still invest in technology solutions as needed. See them <a href="https://www.hunsakerhome.com" target="_blank">here.</a>
