                    <h4>When Talking About Technology...</h3>
                    <p>Every business has its own needs and requires a certain set of skills. I have specific experience
                        in certain fields, and this section is here to inform you if my skills will be able to help achieve
                        your business' technology goals. Some are skills gained through studies, others are through experience.
                        Perhaps your solutions require more or less skills than I possess. As a note, many solutions can be 
                        developed through different methods, some of which may require more or less skills at higher or lower
                        costs. I can help inform you of the big picture and what to expect as transparently as I can. Click 
                        below to see what I can offer your business.
                    </p>
